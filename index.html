      <p id="aboutme">
      
      <br /><br />
       I was born and raised in a remote village (popularly called Ukhubari Tapu) of Syangja district in Nepal, 
       the mountainous country in south asia. Although not acquainted with any means of science and technology during my school years 
       (not even with the electricity and motor vehicles), I was very fond of starring at the majestic
        view of the night sky as seen from my home town, undimmed by the city lights. I had have a curious mind to know 
        the secret of the astronomical objects and the distances these objects were probing.
        It was only after I got to Kathmandu (the capital city of Nepal) to start my higher education that I discovered
         about the science that deals with the study of the Universe was called Astrophysics.  <br /> <br /> 
         
        I did my Bachelor and Masters degrees in Physics from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. 
        My masters thesis was focussed on General Relativity and Cosmology in which I studied the effect of Kerr
        parameter on the rotation curve of galaxies, under the supervision of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udayraj_Khanal">Prof. Udayraj Khanal</a>, 
        a renowned theorist and a science motivator in Nepal.
         Then, I moved to University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA to pursue my PhD in Physics.
         
       During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of 
       <a href="http://boson.physics.sc.edu/~kulkarni/About_Me.html">Prof. Varsha P. Kulkarni</a>
       to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at high-redshift using the 
       quasar absorption line systems. 
       My <a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6849&context=etd">PhD thesis</a>
        was about the cosmic metal evolution during the first ~1 billion years
         after the big bang using gas-rich quasar absorbers. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral
         researcher at <a href="https://fis.ucv.cl/grupo-acg/">Instituto de Física</a>, 
         Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV), Chile, funded by 
         ESO-Chile Joint Committee grant to study the circum-galactic medium (CGM) at high-redshift through 
         the gravitational-arc tomography technique, under the supervision of
         <a href="https://sites.google.com/pucv.cl/ntejos"> Prof. Nicolas Tejos</a>.

      <h2 style="padding-left:185px;color:green;font-size:30px">My Research</h2>
      <p id="research"> My research is mainly focussed on the absorption line systems and 
      their contribution to the galaxy formation and evolution in the distant universe. 
      I use quasars as the background source of light to probe the foreground galaxies.
      The photons that left the quasars several billion years back in time,
       travel through the circum-galactic medium(CGM) of the intervening galaxies 
       and the properties of the galaxy environments get imprinted
       in the spectra of the background quasars. I'm particularly interested in the 
       sub-DLAs/DLAs absorbers which dominate the neutral gas mass
       density of the universe and are the gas reservoirs for star formation at high-redshift.
       <br /> <br /> 
       I have used some of the world's largest 
       telescopes such as Keck Telescope in Hawaii, Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in 
       Arizona, Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Magellan Telescopes in Chile for the 
       spectroscopic observation of the quasars both at the high and medium resolution
        and in the optical as well as NIR wavelengths.
       Following are some highlights of 
      the research I'm involved in.  </p>
      <h4 style="padding-left:185px;color:green">Dust, metals, and gas kinematics in high-z DLAs</h4>
      <p> Observations of DLAs at 0 < z < 4.5 indicate that their metallicity decreases 
      at a modest rate of about 0.2 dex per unit redshift. However, 
      some studies have reported a sudden drop in DLA metallicity at z > 4.7 which, 
      if real, may suggest sudden changes in gas enrichment processes.
      This relatively small z > 4.7 sample is based almost 
      entirely on the elements Si and Fe which show significant depletion on dust grains 
      in the ISM of the Milky Way (MW). Indeed, Si and Fe are observed
       widely to be depleted in DLAs as well. Given the
        potentially interesting implications of a sudden drop in metallicity at z ~ 5 and 
        the conflict such a drop would produce with existing chemical evolution models,
         it is especially important to check with a larger sample using undepleted 
         elements (e.g. S, O). The measurements at z > 4.5 are highly challenging because 
         of the severe blending of metal lines with the dense Lyman-alpha forest, 
         difficulty in continuum fitting, and the low S/N reached in the spectra of 
         the high-z quasars. We are expanding the measurements of 
         S and/or O in sub-DLAs and DLAs at z > 4.5. After combining a handful of dust-free metallicity 
         measurements from the literature with our new measurements at z > 4.5, 
         we observed the metallicity value to be in excellent agreement with the prediction
          inferred from lower redshift DLAs (see Fig. 1 (Left)). This supports the 
          interpretation that the metallicity evolution is smooth at z ∼ 5, rather 
          than declining suddenly at z > 4.7. The primary reason our finding differs from 
          that of previous studies appears to lie in the fact that we are focusing on 
          elements that do not deplete on to dust grains. Furthermore, these measurements 
          indicate that the metallicity evolution trends for the DLAs and sub-DLAs may be 
          similar at this early epoch.<br /> <br />
          
Moreover, a significant fraction of the z∼5 absorbers show evidence of depletion of
 elements onto dust grains, e.g. low [Si/O] or [Fe/O]. In a substantial fraction of 
 absorbers at z > 4.5, the extent of dust depletion, as judged by the 
 parameter F⋆ (Jenkins 2009), appears to be at least as significant as 
 (and in some cases stronger than) the typical depletion found in lower-redshift absorbers.
  <br /> <br />
  The gas kinematics of a galaxy can be understood from measuring the velocity 
      dispersion of its gas. The value of the velocity dispersion may depend on the 
      inflow or outflow of gases within the galaxy and also on rotation in the disk of the
       galaxy which depends on the galaxy mass. If the velocity dispersion depends 
       primarily on mass, and the role played by gas flows is small, then the velocity
        dispersion vs. metallicity relation can suggest a relationship between mass and
         metallicity of absorber host galaxies. In lower redshift DLAs and sub-DLAs, a 
         fairly tight correlation exists between the metallicity and the velocity 
         dispersion of the gas. However, our recent study show a somewhat flatter relation at z∼5 
          (see Fig. 1 (Right)), possibly suggesting that the z∼5 absorbers may be tracing 
          a different population of galaxies than the lower redshift absorbers .<br /> <br />
          
          All of these findings were part of my PhD thesis and were also published in 
          MNRAS in recent years (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.3559P/abstract">Poudel et al. 2018</a>, 
          <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1008P/abstract">Poudel et al. 2020</a>).

      <h4 style="padding-left:185px;color:green">Nucleosynthesis and Relative Abundances</h4>
      <p> The first 1 billion years of the cosmic metal evolution are influenced by the 
      nucleosynthetic signatures from the early stars. Measuring abundances during the 
      z ∼ 5 epoch can constrain the nature of the pristine Population III stars and the 
      early generations of metal-poor Population II stars. The initial mass function 
      (IMF) of Population III stars is still a subject of debate. Measurements of 
      relative abundances such as [Si/O] and [C/O] in chemically young systems can 
      put a strong constraint on the mass of the progenitor Population III stars (e.g. Cooke et al. 2017). 
      We examine the relative 
      abundances in the metal poor z ∼ 5 DLAs to study the nucleosynthetic signatures of the early stars 
      (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1008P/abstract">Poudel et al. 2020</a>).
